Short Bio
======
Since November 2017, I am pursuing a PhD degree under Prof. Michael Unser and Dr. Julien Fageot at the Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG), Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.

Research interest
======
I am interested in theoretical and algorithmic aspects of inverse problems in signal processing. I study continuous-domain signal reconstruction models, and develop discretization methods that preserve the properties of the continuous model and that can be solved algorithmically. Keywords:
* continuous-domain inverse problems;
* sparsity;
* splines;
* convex optimization;
* proximal algorithms.

Hobbies
======
I enjoy playing strategy games. In particular, I have been playing go competitively since my childhood; I am a 5-time French national champion. You can follow my tournament results [here](https://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/Player_Card.php?&key=12950872). I also enjoy doing sports, particularly racket sports. I play badminton at a competitive level.
