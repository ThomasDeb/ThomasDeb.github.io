Since November 2017, I am pursuing a PhD degree under Prof. [Michael Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/) and Dr. [Julien Fageot](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/fageot/index.html) at the [Biomedical Imaging Group](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/) (BIG), Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.

Previously, I received an M.Sc. in [Mathematics, Vision and Learning](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/) at ENS Paris-Saclay (2016-2017), and an M.Sc. in Engineering (applied mathematics major) at [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu) (2013-2016).

Research interests
======
I am interested in theoretical and algorithmic aspects of inverse problems in signal processing with sparsity priors. More specifically, I study inverse problems that are formulated in the continuous domain, and develop spline-based discretization methods to solve them algorithmically. Keywords:
* continuous-domain inverse problems;
* sparsity;
* splines;
* convex optimization;
* proximal algorithms.

Hobbies
======
I enjoy playing strategy games. In particular, I have been playing go competitively since my childhood; I am a 5-time French national champion. You can follow my tournament results [here](https://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/Player_Card.php?&key=12950872). I also enjoy doing sports, particularly racket sports. I play badminton at a competitive level.
